# **Linear Equations**

## Chapter 3: Solving Linear Equations in One Variable

### What is a Linear Equation in One Variable?

A **linear equation in one variable** is an equation that can be written in the form:

`ax + b = c`

Where:

-   `x` is the variable
-   `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants
-   `a ≠ 0`

---

### Solving Basic Linear Equations

#### Example 1: Normal

`2x + 3 = 11`

**Step 1:** Subtract 3 from both sides  
`2x = 8`

**Step 2:** Divide by 2  
`x = 4`

---

### Solving Equations with Fractions

#### Example 2: Fraction Involved

`x / 3 + 2 = 5`

**Step 1:** Subtract 2 from both sides  
`x/3 = 3`

**Step 2:** Multiply both sides by 3  
`x = 9`

> Tip: Eliminate all denominators first by multiplying with the **LCM** of all denominators.

---

### Solving Equations with Decimals

#### Example 3: Decimal Involved

`0.4x - 1.2 = 0.8`

**Step 1:** Add 1.2 to both sides  
`0.4x = 2.0`

**Step 2:** Divide by 0.4  
`x = 5`

---

## Chapter 4: Types of Solutions

Linear equations can have **one solution**, **no solution**, or **infinitely many solutions**.

---

### 1. Conditional Equation (One Solution)

An equation is **conditional** if it is true for **only one value** of the variable.

**Example:**  
`3x - 2 = 10` → `x = 4`

✅ Only one solution → Conditional

---

### 2. Contradiction (No Solution)

When solving leads to a **false statement** like `0 = 5`, the equation has **no solution**.

**Example:**

`2x + 3 = 2x - 4`

Subtract `2x` from both sides:  
`3 = -4` → ❌ False

❌ No value of `x` satisfies the equation  
❌ No solution → Contradiction

---

### 3. Identity (Infinitely Many Solutions)

When both sides of the equation are **exactly the same**, the equation is true for **all values** of `x`.

**Example:**

`4x + 2 = 4x + 2`

Subtract `4x` from both sides:  
`2 = 2` → ✅ Always true

♾️ All values of `x` are solutions → Identity

### Summary

| Type        | Description                      | Example           |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Conditional | One specific solution            | `x = 3`           |
| No Solution | False statement (contradiction)  | `2x + 1 = 2x - 3` |
| Identity    | Always true (infinite solutions) | `5x + 2 = 5x + 2` |

---

### Practice Problems

1. Solve: `5x - 7 = 18`
2. Solve: `(x/2) + 1 = 4`
3. Solve: `0.5x + 0.2 = 1.2`
4. Determine the type: `6x + 3 = 6x + 8`
5. Determine the type: `4x - 1 = 4x - 1`

---

**Tips:**

-   Always simplify both sides first.
-   Watch out for fractions and decimals—clear them early!
-   Check your answer by substituting back into the original equation.

## Chapter 5: Repeating Decimals to Fractions

### Key Concept

Every repeating decimal is a **rational number** (can be written as a fraction).  
**Example**:

-   \\(  0.\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3}  \\)
-   \\(  0.\overline{12} = \frac{4}{33}  \\)

---

### Conversion Steps (Pure Repeating Decimals)

**Rule**: For \\(  0.\overline{ab}  \\), fraction = \\(  \frac{ab}{99}  \\).

#### Example 1: Single-Digit Repeater

Convert \\(  0.\overline{7}  \\) to a fraction:

1. Let \\(  x = 0.\overline{7}  \\)
2. Multiply by 10: \\(  10x = 7.\overline{7}  \\)
3. Subtract original: \\(  10x - x = 7.\overline{7} - 0.\overline{7}  \\)
4. Solve: \\(  9x = 7  \\) → \\(  x = \frac{7}{9}  \\)

#### Example 2: Double-Digit Repeater

Convert \\(  0.\overline{45}  \\) to a fraction:

1. Let \\(  x = 0.\overline{45}  \\)
2. Multiply by 100: \\(  100x = 45.\overline{45}  \\)
3. Subtract: \\(  100x - x = 45.\overline{45} - 0.\overline{45}  \\)
4. Solve: \\(  99x = 45  \\) → \\(  x = \frac{45}{99} = \frac{5}{11}  \\)

---

### Mixed Repeating Decimals (Non-Repeating + Repeating Parts)

**Rule**: For \\(  0.a\overline{bc}  \\), fraction = \\(  \frac{abc - a}{990}  \\).

#### Example 3: Mixed Decimal

Convert \\(  0.2\overline{6}  \\) to a fraction:

1. Let \\(  x = 0.2\overline{6}  \\)
2. Multiply by 10: \\(  10x = 2.\overline{6}  \\)
3. Multiply by 100: \\(  100x = 26.\overline{6}  \\)
4. Subtract step 2 from step 3: \\(  90x = 24  \\)
5. Solve: \\(  x = \frac{24}{90} = \frac{4}{15}  \\)

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Incorrect multiplier**:
    - For \\(  0.\overline{ab}  \\), multiply by 100 (not 10).
2. **Forgetting to simplify**:
    - Always reduce fractions (e.g., \\(  \frac{45}{99} = \frac{5}{11}  \\)).
3. **Miscounting digits**:
    - \\(  0.\overline{123}  \\) has 3 repeating digits → multiply by 1000.

---

### Practice Problems

1. Convert \\(  0.\overline{9}  \\) to a fraction. _(Hint: It equals 1!)_
2. Convert \\(  0.3\overline{18}  \\) to a fraction.  
   **Solution**:
    - Let \\(  x = 0.3\overline{18}  \\)
    - \\(  100x = 31.\overline{18}  \\)
    - \\(  10x = 3.\overline{18}  \\)
    - Subtract: \\(  90x = 28  \\) → \\(  x = \frac{28}{90} = \frac{14}{45}  \\)

2. Divide by 2:  
   \[ y = \frac{12 - 3x}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad y = 6 - \frac{3}{2}x \]

---

#### Example 2: Formula from Geometry

**Solve for \\(  r  \\):**  
\[ C = 2\pi r \]

\[ y = mx + b \]

**Steps**:

1. Subtract \\(  b  \\):  
   \[ y - b = mx \]

---

#### Example 5: Real-World Application (Temperature Conversion)

**Solve for \\(  F  \\):**  
\[ C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32) \]

**Steps**:

1. Multiply by \\(  \frac{9}{5}  \\):  
   \[ \frac{9}{5}C = F - 32 \]
2. Add 32:  
   \[ F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \]

---

#### Example 6: Complex Formula (Kinematics)

**Solve for \\(  t  \\):**  
\[ s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \]

**Steps**:

1. Rewrite as quadratic equation:  
   \[ \frac{1}{2}at^2 + ut - s = 0 \]
2. Apply quadratic formula:  
   \[ t = \frac{-u \pm \sqrt{u^2 + 2as}}{a} \]

**Note**: Discard negative time solutions.

---

### Common Mistakes

1. **Incorrect distribution**:
    - Wrong: \\(  \frac{a + b}{c} \neq \frac{a}{c} + b  \\).
2. **Dividing variables**:
    - Ensure the divisor is not zero (e.g., \\(  x  \\) in Example 4).
3. **Sign errors**:
    - When moving terms, change signs (e.g., \\(  +b  \\) becomes \\(  -b  \\)).

### Advanced Applications

#### Example 11: Break-Even Analysis

**Problem**: A product costs \$7 to make and sells for \$15. Fixed costs are \$4000. Find break-even quantity.  
**Solution**:

##### **Step-by-Step Understanding**:

1. **What is Break-Even?**

    - The point where **total revenue = total costs** (no profit, no loss).
    - _Analogy_: Imagine selling lemonade. You need to sell enough cups to pay for lemons, sugar, and your stand rental.

2. **Define Variables**:

    - Let \\(  x  \\) = number of items sold.

3. **Cost Components**:

    - **Variable Cost**: \$7 per item → Total variable cost = \\(  7x  \\).
    - **Fixed Cost**: \$4000 (doesn’t change with number of items).
    - **Total Cost**: \\(  7x + 4000  \\).

4. **Revenue**:

    - Selling price = \$15/item → Total revenue = \\(  15x  \\).

5. **Set Up Equation**:  
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = \text{Total Cost} \\
   15x = 7x + 4000
   \]

6. **Solve**:  
   \[
   15x - 7x = 4000 \newline
   8x = 4000 \newline
   x = 500
   \]

✅ **Conclusion**: Sell **500 items** to break even.

#### Example 12: Distance Between Trains

**Problem**: Train A leaves at 60 mph. Train B leaves 2 hours later at 80 mph. When will B catch A?  
**Solution**:

1. Let \\(  t  \\) = time after B departs
2. Distance A: \\(  60(t + 2)  \\)
3. Distance B: \\(  80t  \\)
4. Set equal: \\(  80t = 60t + 120  \\) → \\(  t = 6  \\) hours

#### Example 13: Percentage Change

**Problem**: A price increased by 25% then decreased by 20%. Final price is \$120. Find original price.  
**Solution**:

##### **Step-by-Step Understanding**:

1. **Understand the Changes**:

    - **First**: Price goes up by 25% (×1.25).
    - **Second**: New price is reduced by 20% (×0.80).

2. **Define Variable**:

    - Let \\(  x  \\) = original price.

3. **Set Up Equation**:  
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = x \times 1.25 \times 0.80 \newline
   120 = x \times 1.00 \newline
   x = 120
   \]

🤔 **Why 1.00?**

-   \\(  1.25 \times 0.80 = 1.00  \\) → The changes cancel out!
-   _Analogy_: If you increase a number by 25% then decrease it by 20%, you return to the original value.

✅ **Original Price**: \$120.

#### Example 14: Consecutive Integers

**Problem**: Sum of three consecutive odd integers is 75. Find them.
